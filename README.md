### Example of Custom Configuration:

In the VSCode configuration file (`settings.json`), add the custom scripts you want to execute. Here is an example:

```json
"gigachad.customScripts": [
  {
    "name": "build:docker",
    "command": "docker-compose up --build",
    "group": "example-app"
  },
]
```
